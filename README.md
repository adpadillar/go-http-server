# Go HTTP Server

This is a very simple HTTP server built with Golang for me to better understand the language. 

## Usage

Run the `bin/main` executable pointing to a folder you want to serve

```bash
bin/main ../path/to-your/folder
```

It will start a local server in [localhost:3333](localhost:3333)
